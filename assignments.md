# Asynchronous Work
#### Most asynchronous work will happen over slack.
Asynchronous work is meant to take up the balance of our class time, since our live zoom sessions are only 1:15 long. Most often, asynchronous activities will take place as discussions over slack in the \#async_curdev slack channel. Usually, you will be asked to post and then respond to posts from others. As such, it is important to the whole class that you do not wait until the start of the following class to do your asynchronous work. If possible, take the remaining time at the end of our zoom sessions to at least add your post.

# Session 02: 09/15
## Assignment
* title: **02_new-course.md**
* Come up with an idea for a new comptuer science course that you would teach at your current school.
* Make sure to include the following:
  * General description of the course
  * Target audiance
  * Where it fits along with the other courses in your school

## Async
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel:
  * Share a topic that you are considering to use for the unit plan project.
  * Explain what class it would fit into, and why you chose this particular topic.
  * What computer science curricular needs does this topic fill?

# Session 01: 09/08
## Assignment:
* filename: **01_compare.md**
* Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).
  * If you teach CSA or CSP, you could use a different version of that course.
  * For other courses, look around for pre-packaged courses with similar aims. Many of the Curriculum providers we looked at for AP CSP also provide intro courses at the least.
  * Alternatively: Elementary school teachers that cannot find anything similar to compare to, or masters students may opt to compare two of the APCSP curricula that were linked in the Async portion of the assignment.
* Focus on the following:
  * Major differences
  * Major similiarities
  * Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
  * Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?

## Asynchronous:
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel:
* Have one person from each breakout room post about the selected CSP curriculum with the following information:
  - What tool(s) are used
  - Is there a specific instructional focus, if so, what?
  - Is there a specific content focus, if so, what?
* Each person from that room should reply to that post with the following:
  - How well does it match up with the [College Board's CSP Course Description](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-at-a-glance.pdf)?
  - What is the best part of this curriculum?
  - What is something you believe could be improved about this curriculum? How would you improve it?

# Session 00: 09/01
## Assignment:
* filename: **00_standards.md**
  * Pick 2 specific NY CS standards and describe a lesson/task/assignment that addresses your selected standards, explain how.
  * You can use the same lesson/task/assignment for both, or different ones.

## Asynchronous:
* In the \#async_curdev slack channel, continued from class:
* As a group, create a slack post that summarizes your group's discussion on the points you were discussing:
  * Do you think this concept is a major part of computer science?
  * How well do the individual standards support the concept?
  * How well do the standards seem to conform to given grade levels?
  * Are there areas of this concept that are missing?
* Individually: Look over the different concept/sub-concept threads. Pick 3 (of the ones you didnâ€™t discuss in class), read the related material for those three, and provide your response to the prompts.
